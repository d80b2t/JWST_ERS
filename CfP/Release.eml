Director’s Discretionary Early Release Science

Call for Proposals

Release Date: May 22, 2017

Proposal Deadline: Aug 18, 2017

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is pleased to announce the Call for Proposals for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Director’s Discretionary Early Release Science (DD ERS) program. JWST is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The DD ERS Call for Proposals is available at: https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/display/JSP/JWST+Director%27s+Discretionary+Early+Release+Science+Call+for+Proposals.

This document provides additional information on the JWST DD ERS program, expanding on the goals, requirements and policies presented in the Call for Notices of Intent. This Call is open only to proposers who submitted Notices of Intent (NoI) by the March 3 deadline. Proposals should be submitted using the Astronomers Proposal Tool and are due by Aug 18, 2017 8:00pm EDT. Proposers must identify the NoI corresponding to their proposal. The results of the selection will be announced in Nov 2017.

The Call for Proposals provides details on the proposal and budget submission process along with supporting documentation. Instructions for using the Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT) to specify observations and documentation of special considerations for successful early execution of observations, and about STScI pipeline data products, processing and analysis software, and their anticipated availability are also provided.  The latter should inform the design of science-enabling products to be developed and released by DD ERS core teams, and the formulation of workplans, preliminary budgets, and schedules, which are required elements of the proposal.  All programmatic and technical information, as well as specific guidelines for proposal preparation, is available electronically from the JWST Documentation website:  https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu. Community members considering proposing in response to the Cycle 1 General Observer Call, planned to be issued on November 30 2017, may also find this information useful. 

Participation in this program is open to all categories of organizations, both domestic and foreign, including educational institutions, profit and nonprofit organizations, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies.

Questions can be submitted to the JWST helpdesk at http://jwsthelp.stsci.edu.
