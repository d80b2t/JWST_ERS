# The DD ERS program is guided by the following key principles:

- Projects must be substantive science demonstration programs that utilize key instrument modes to provide representative scientific datasets of broad interest to researchers in major astrophysical sub-disciplines. Note that a meritorious DD ERS project need not cover every mode of the observatory. The request should match the focused science goals of the proposal.

- Projects must design, create, and deliver science-enabling products to help the community understand JWST's capabilities.  An initial set of products must be delivered by the release of the Cycle 2 GO Call for Proposals (September 2019).  Each project must define a core team to be responsible for the timely delivery of such products according to a proposed project management plan, with performance subject to periodic review.
