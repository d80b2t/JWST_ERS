This e-mail is being sent to all prospective DD ERS PIs.
 
Thanks for your notice of intent to submit a DD ERS proposal. We received a total of 200 submissions. Up to 15 proposals will be selected for execution as part of the DD ERS program. The final version of the Call for Proposals will be released on May 19 2017 and will include further information on the proposal submission process and grant funding. The ERS proposal deadline is August 18 2017.
 
As a reminder, the submitted proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria:
·  The extent to which the project will improve community understanding of JWST science capabilities and guide subsequent JWST observations;
·  The effectiveness in providing deliverables that include quantitative, data-related measurements that will support the development of Cycle 2 proposals;
·  The extent to which science-enabling products will be developed to enrich overall scientific return of the mission;
·  The credibility of the management plan for achieving the project goals in a timely manner, particularly the development and delivery of science-enabling products for the community;
·  The overall scientific merit of the program; its significance to major astrophysical sub-disciplines, and to astronomy in general.
 
Particular emphasis will be given to the first two criteria. In preparing your proposal, please ensure that each criterion is addressed appropriately. All proposals must demonstrate that the unique capabilities of JWST are required to address the proposed science goals, and must be technically feasible. STScI recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive scientific teams involved in the formulation of ERS proposals.
 
The Cycle 1 General Observer Call for Proposals will be issued on November 30 2017 with a proposal deadline of March 2 2018. GO proposals will be scheduled concurrently with DD ERS proposals during the early stages of Cycle 1. Proposers may wish to consider whether their proposals are better suited to the Cycle 1 GO Calls in light of the evaluation criteria for DD ERS proposals.
