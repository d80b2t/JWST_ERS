\section*{Summary of DD-ERS Data Products}
%Examples
Our primary SEP task and goal is to produce a Python package that
quickly manipulates and analyzes the full MRS Level 3 data, in
particular the MRS Spectral Cubes and 1D spectra.  We will take the
output from the third stage of the pipeline for MRS spectroscopy, the
CALIFU3 level data and analyse this.  We note there is already Python
legacy code for this type of analysis: {\href
https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/}{\tt
spectral-cube.readthedocs.io}.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
With {\it a maximum} of 6 months between the first ERS observations
and the Cycle 2 GO Call for Proposals, 
this will likely be too short for full dissemination of our findings, novel
techniques and science results in the traditional manner, i.e. via
published journal articles. Moreover, ongoing updated versions of our
analyses and codes are envisaged to happen until right up to the Cycle 2
deadline.  To solve these issues, we will fully employ the power of a
code version repository system, in our case GitHub, to keep the
community informed and updated with our SEPs. GitHub {\it has code
versioning automatically built-in} so proper referencing of
e.g. technical notes is straight-forward.

processeing pipelines and analysis tools in support of the preparation
of both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 proposals.  The key links are::

\section*{Delivery Schedule for Science-Enabling Products.} 
\vspace{-6pt}
Our ERQ ERS proposal is the first part of a multi-cycle proposal
project and plan.  As such, we are {\it already highly motivated to
produce the data processing tools, codes, documentation and identify
the critical science-enabling products well in advance of the release
of the Cycle 2 Call for Proposals (September 2019).}
Our major milestones are::

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf Before Cycle 1 GO Proposal Deadline (end Feb 2018):} 
Delivery of the first set (‘beta’) of MIRI MRS SEPs before the Cycle 1 GO Deadline (March 2018). 
Proin non tempus velit. Etiam laoreet, enim nec scelerisque dictum, tortor massa tempor enim, id pretium justo quam ac lectus. Maecenas diam nibh, interdum at lobortis sit amet, dignissim et quam. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
 {\bf Prior to Launch (March 2018 - October 2018):} 
The release of our v1.0.0, with MIRSim mock data. 
Sed tincidunt faucibus risus, congue tempus nisl consectetur eget. Suspendisse venenatis turpis ut risus aliquam interdum. In at velit sed ligula dictum dignissim ut et dui. Curabitur ac scelerisque purus.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf Commissioning (November 2018-April 2019):} 
Ramp-up of the Postdoctoral Fellows. 
Donec elit tortor, scelerisque ac molestie id, hendrerit sit amet
ipsum. Maecenas non tempus sem. Pellentesque ut enim velit, eu
sagittis elit. Nulla in elementum erat.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf ERS/Cycle 1 (April 2019-September 2019):} 
Rapid version updates once the start of science operations commences
in April 2019.  In dictum arcu at nisi porttitor commodo. Donec felis
felis, elementum sit amet ultrices ac, interdum nec ante. Nullam eget
faucibus lectus. Donec vitae eros sapien, et faucibus ligula. Aenean
pharetra viverra fermentum.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf After Cycle 2 GO Deadline (post-September 2019):} 
Continue to provide regular (every 6 months) major version update.
