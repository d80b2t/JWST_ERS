\section{Delivery Schedule for Science-Enabling Products.} 
Here we give the delivery schedule for science-enabling products. 
Proposals must present a delivery schedule for science-enabling products. A description of STScI pipeline data products, processing and analysis software, and their anticipated availability, will be provided by the May 2017 release of the final version of this Call for Proposals.  Proposers may consider multiple deliveries, with more advanced products provided over longer timescales. Proposals may include the collection, processing and analysis of ancillary data as part of an integrated DD ERS proposal.

\section{Co-Investigators and Delivery of Science-Enabling Products.}
Co-Investigators, together with the PI (and any Co-PIs) comprise a core team with the responsibility of developing and delivering science-enabling products as described in the proposal, as well as carrying out selected key aspects of the science investigations.  A Co-I must have a well-defined, and generally sustained, continuing role in team activities, serve under the direction of the PI, or co-PI(s). Co-investigators may or may not receiving funding, pending eligibility, through the DD ERS program.
