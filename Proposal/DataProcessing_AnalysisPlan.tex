\section*{Summary of DD-ERS Data Products}
%Examples
Our primary SEP task and goal is to produce a Python package that
quickly manipulates and analyzes the full MRS Level 3 data, in
particular the MRS Spectral Cubes and 1D spectra.  We will take the
output from the third stage of the pipeline for MRS spectroscopy, the
CALIFU3 level data and analyse this.  We note there is already Python
legacy code for this type of analysis: {\href
https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/}{\tt
spectral-cube.readthedocs.io}.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf NOTE TO NPR, THIS NEEDS UPDATED!!} 
Further items that we will deliver include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Participation in community briefings organized by STScI; 
written/oral updates on progress; 
written/oral documentation of lessons-learned. 
\item Software with documentation
data analysis and modeling
enhanced data processing
\item Enhanced data products with documentation
aligned multiband images, extracted spectra, etc
catalogs
\end{itemize}



\section*{General Outline and Motvations Driving Data Processing \& Analysis}
We are already ensuring open access to representative data sets, processeing pipelines and analysis tools in 
support of the preparation of both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 proposals. 
%engage a broad cross-section of the astronomical community in familiarizing themselves with JWST data and scientific capabilities.

MIRI data simulations (at ESA) include an Integral Field observation
with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS), a Low Resolution
Spectrograph (LRS) observation, and an imaging observation. (Credit:

{\bf MIRISim does not produce final, calibrated data. 
MIRISim produces stuff that looks like it has come off of MIRI.}

\section*{Delivery Schedule for Science-Enabling Products.} 
Our ERQ ERS proposal is the first part of a multi-cycle proposal
project and plan.  As such, we are {\it already highly motivated to
produce the data processing tools, codes, documentation and identify
the critical science-enabling products well in advance of the release
of the Cycle 2 Call for Proposals (September 2019).}
Our major milestones are laid out here::
%Proposals must present a delivery schedule for science-enabling products. A description of STScI pipeline data products, processing and analysis software, and their anticipated availability, will be provided by the May 2017 release of the final version of this Call for Proposals.  Proposers may consider multiple deliveries, with more advanced products provided over longer timescales. Proposals may include the collection, processing and analysis of ancillary data as part of an integrated DD ERS proposal.

\section*{Co-Investigators and Delivery of Science-Enabling Products.}
Everyone named on this proposal is part of the ``core team''. 
%Co-Investigators, together with the PI (and any Co-PIs) comprise a core team with the responsibility of developing and delivering science-enabling products as described in the proposal, as well as carrying out selected key aspects of the science investigations.  A Co-I must have a well-defined, and generally sustained, continuing role in team activities, serve under the direction of the PI, or co-PI(s). Co-investigators may or may not receiving funding, pending eligibility, through the DD ERS program. 
%\medskip \medskip \noindent
%\smallskip \smallskip

%Our Science-Enabling Products team consists of five main parts::
%\begin{itemize}
 %   \item ``Core Coders''; 
  %  \item Website and \href{http://miri-mrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{{\tt ReadTheDocs}} Writers; 
   % \item Observational Follow-up; 
   % \item Senior members of staff, able to supply students/ ask for funding; 
   % \item A small steering committee.
