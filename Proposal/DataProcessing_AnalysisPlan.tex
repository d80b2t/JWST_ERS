\section{General Outline and Motvations Driving Data Processing \& Analysis}
Our ERQ ERS proposal is the first part of a multi-cycle proposal project and plan. 
As such, we are {\it already highly motivated to produce the data processing tools, codes, documentation 
and identify the critical science-enabling products well in advance of the release of the Cycle 2 Call for Proposals (September 2019).} 

Our Science-Enabling Products team consists of four main parts::
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Core Coders''; 
\item  Wedsite and {\tt readthedocs} Writers; 
\item Observational Follow-up; 
\item Senior members of staff, operating akin to a steering committee. 
\end{itemize}

\section{{\tt mrs\_analyzer}} 
{\tt mrs\_analyzer} is  a Python module for analyzing MRS data; 
{\tt mrsfringe} is a Python module for mitigating MRS fringing issues; 

And will integrate with...

\section{Delivery Schedule for Science-Enabling Products.} 
Here we give the delivery schedule for science-enabling products. 
Proposals must present a delivery schedule for science-enabling products. A description of STScI pipeline data products, processing and analysis software, and their anticipated availability, will be provided by the May 2017 release of the final version of this Call for Proposals.  Proposers may consider multiple deliveries, with more advanced products provided over longer timescales. Proposals may include the collection, processing and analysis of ancillary data as part of an integrated DD ERS proposal.

\section{Co-Investigators and Delivery of Science-Enabling Products.}
Co-Investigators, together with the PI (and any Co-PIs) comprise a core team with the responsibility of developing and delivering science-enabling products as described in the proposal, as well as carrying out selected key aspects of the science investigations.  A Co-I must have a well-defined, and generally sustained, continuing role in team activities, serve under the direction of the PI, or co-PI(s). Co-investigators may or may not receiving funding, pending eligibility, through the DD ERS program.
