\section*{Summary of DD-ERS Data Products}
%Examples
\vspace{-4pt}
Our primary SEP task and goal is to produce a Python package that
quickly manipulates and analyzes the full MRS Level 3 data, in
particular the MRS Spectral Cubes and 1D spectra.  We will take the
output from the third stage of the pipeline for MRS spectroscopy, the
CALIFU3 level data and analyse this.  We note there is already Python
legacy code for this type of analysis: {\href
https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/}{\tt
spectral-cube.readthedocs.io}.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
With {\it a maximum} of 6 months between the first ERS observations
and the Cycle 2 GO Call for Proposals, 
this will likely be too short for full dissemination of our findings, novel
techniques and science results in the traditional manner, i.e. via
published journal articles. Moreover, ongoing updated versions of our
analyses and codes are envisaged to happen until right up to the Cycle 2
deadline.  To solve these issues, we will fully employ the power of a
code version repository system, in our case GitHub, to keep the
community informed and updated with our SEPs. GitHub {\it has code
versioning automatically built-in} so proper referencing of
e.g. technical notes is straight-forward.

\section*{Code Repositories and Documentation}
\vspace{-8pt}
We are already ensuring open access to representative data sets,
processeing pipelines and analysis tools in support of the preparation
of both Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 proposals.  The key links are::

\section*{Sub-kiloparsec resolution at High-redshift}
\vspace{-6pt}
%\smallskip \smallskip
%\noindent
If the PAH emission from the ERQs is dominated by dusty non-nuclear
star formation then we may expect it to be spatially resolved on the
scale of any star-forming disk present. Typical galaxy discs at $z=2.5$
have half-light radii of $3-5$kpc. The pixel scale of the MRS is 0.2-0.3''  
with a spatial FWHM of 0.5'' (4kpc) and 0.8'' (6.4kpc) for the 3.3 and 6.2$\mu$m lines
respectively, when redshifted to $z=2.5$ (with the 4-point dither
pattern employed). These specifications and relative sizes are very
similar to those of the KMOS NIR IFU instrument on the VLT (0.2’’
pixel scale, median Paranal seeing 0.7’’). Our team has extensive
experience of analysing star forming galaxies at $z=1-2$ with KMOS
(i.e. the KROSS survey, P.I. Stott) and are
therefore ideally placed to use that expertise to create post-pipeline
IFU analysis tools directly analogous to those used in the KROSS
survey. These will produce spatially resolved maps of PAH line
strengths and velocities using the wavelength information to subsample
the spatial PSF. In this way we can probe the spatial competition
between the influence of star formation and the central AGN.

\section*{MIRISim}
\vspace{-6pt}
\href{http://www.miricle.org/MIRICLE2/devel/doc/mirisim/User_Guide/index.html}
{\tt MIRSim}, is a MIRI data simulations which includes an Integral
Field observations with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (P.I., P. Klaassen, 
University of Edinburgh).  MIRISim does not
produce final, calibrated data, instead it produces data equivalent to
that straight from MIRI. We will initially concentrate on the Level 3
data cubts, and MIRISim will be a superb input for pre-Launch tests
and developement of the ERS ERQ SEPs that we want to develop.  {\it
Given the pixel scales of the MRS IFU, and the fact that 1'' is
$\approx$8 kpc at $z\sim2.5$ a major goal of our SEPs will be to
deliver software and analyses that samples the data on a sub-pixel,
sub-kiloparsec scale.  MIRISim and our team's recent VLT/KMOS
expertise will acomplish this.}



\section*{Delivery Schedule for Science-Enabling Products.} 
\vspace{-6pt}
Our ERQ ERS proposal is the first part of a multi-cycle proposal
project and plan.  As such, we are {\it already highly motivated to
produce the data processing tools, codes, documentation and identify
the critical science-enabling products well in advance of the release
of the Cycle 2 Call for Proposals (September 2019).}
Our major milestones are::

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf Before Cycle 1 GO Proposal Deadline (end Feb 2018):}\\ 
Delivery of the first set (‘beta’) of MIRI MRS SEPs before the Cycle 1 GO Deadline.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
 {\bf Prior to Launch (March 2018 - October 2018):}\\ 
The release of our v1.0.0, with MIRSim mock data. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf Commissioning (November 2018-April 2019):}\\ 
Ramp-up of the Postdoctoral Fellows. 

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf ERS/Cycle 1 (April 2019-September 2019):}\\ 
Rapid version updates once the start of science operations commences
in April 2019.  

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf After Cycle 2 GO Deadline (post-September 2019):}\\ 
Continue to provide regular (every 6 months) major version update.
