\alttargets   % Do not delete this command.
% Enter your plan for for alternative targets here.
We have 14 ERQs that will be observed with ALMA Cycle 5, Band 6, four of which are
our primary targets. The remaining 10 objects are given here as alternative targets. 
%As can be seen, 
The redshifts and e.g. WISE W3/W4-band magnitudes and fluxes are come
from the same distribution as for the core targets, hence there is no need 
to change the observational strategy.
