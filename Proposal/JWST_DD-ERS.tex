      WISE 3.4, 4.6 and 12$\mu {\rm m}$ image of a $z=2.5$ 
      extremely red quasars, selected on their $r-[22]$ colour. This object
      has a 22$\mu$m flux indicative of $L_{IR} \gtrsim 10^{13.5} L_{\odot}$, 
      and one interpretation could be we are witnessing the
      ``birth'' of an unobscured QSO.  }

      SEDs for Type 1 non-BALs in the core ERQ sample (black curve) plus
      blue quasars matched to the core ERQs in W3 magnitude (green curve) as
      in Fig. 8, the Type 1 quasar template QSO1 with and without reddening
      equal to $E(B âˆ’ V) = 0.5$ (light blue, from Polletta et al. 2007), a
      typical Type 2 quasar (QSO2) from Mateos et al. (2013, purple), a
      typical heavily reddened Type 1 quasar (HR1) from Banerji et
      al. (2013), and a typical HotDOG from Tsai et al. (2015). The light
      grey curves are SEDs of individual core ERQs.
