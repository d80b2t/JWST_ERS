      WISE 3.4, 4.6 and 12$\mu {\rm m}$ image of a $z=2.5$ 
      extremely red quasars, selected on their $r-[22]$ colour. This object
      has a 22$\mu$m flux indicative of $L_{IR} \gtrsim 10^{13.5} L_{\odot}$, 
      and one interpretation could be we are witnessing the
      ``birth'' of an unobscured QSO.  }
