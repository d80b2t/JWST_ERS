Dear Nadia, Fred and Rachael,

Simlpy put, would you, along with myself, consider being on the wee "Steering Committee" here?
I would envisage the scope of this being really minimal, and to be blunt, unless we get time,
wouldn't even have to worry about what this might actually entail in practice.

Thanks,
Nic
