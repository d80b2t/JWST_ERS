\section*{{\sc Executive Summary}}

\vspace{-6pt}
\noindent
{\it 1. Justification for ERS time}\\
Our Director's Discretionary time for an Early Release Science
(DD-ERS) program will help the community learn about the longest
wavelength spectrograph on the {\it James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST)}, the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-resolution
spectrometer (MRS).  We will release a suite of science-enabling
products (SEPs) via a public data analysis and code repository that we
have already begun to build: \href{https://github.com/miri-mrs}{\tt
github.com/miri-mrs}.  The accompanying documentation is also already
being written: \href{http://miri-mrs.readthedocs.io/}{{\tt
miri-mrs.readthedocs.io}}.  {\it Our primary SEP goal is to produce a
Python package that quickly manipulates and analyzes the full MRS
Level 3 data, in particular the MRS Spectral Cubes and 1D spectra.}

\smallskip \smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
{\it 2. Project Management Plan \& Budget} \\
Our team members have a long and proven history of delivering SEPs,
catalogs, data products, web access pages, documentation and the
necessary helpdesk support for large collaborations on strict
deadlines.  Our project is led by an STFC Ernest Rutherford Senior
Research Fellow, who is able to contribute 100\% FTE to achieving the
major science goals of the proposal, as well as leading the initial
development of the SEPs. We also ask for support for two postdoctoral
researchers who will be in place at Launch time.

\smallskip \smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
{\it 3. Scientific Justification}\\
Our science case is straight-forward, yet strikes at the heart of a
major and still open extragalactic astrophysical question: {\it What
are the star-formation properties of mid-infrared luminous quasars at
the peak of quasar activity? } We will answer this by looking for the
presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) spectral features in
$z\approx2.5$ infrared bright quasars.  Furthermore, we will use the
IFU capability of MIRI MRS in order to quantify the spatial location
of the IR luminosity. This is an ideal investigation for {\it James
Webb}; no other current or near-future facility, ground or
space-based, has the combination of MIR spectroscopy, angular
resolution and the sensitivity required for accessing the PAH spectral
features at $z>2$, {\it and} being able to spatially resolve their
structure.


\smallskip 
\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
{\it 4. Description of the Targets}\\
We have four primary targets; all are available for early observation.
We also have a back-up list of ten secondary targets, any of which
would allow us to achieve our SEP and Science goals. These fourteen
objects have extensive associated multiwavelength data with our four
primary targets known to exhibit interesting kinematic behavior.

\smallskip 
\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
{\it 5. Team Diversity}\\
Our team is an ensemble of observational extragalactic experts with a
broad geographical dispersion. This is a new collaboration, but with
substantial heritage and expertise from the SDSS, the {\it
HST/Chandra} Deep Field surveys, and more recent ground-based IR IFU
collaborations (e.g., VLT/KMOS).  


\section*{Science Rationale}
\vspace{-6pt}
\noindent
Over 50 years after their formal identification, and over two decades
since the calculation of their space density evolution, several
fundamental facts remain unknown for high-luminosity AGN,
i.e. quasars: What is the main AGN triggering mechanism at the height
of quasar activity at redshifts $z=2-3$? What direct observational
evidence in individual objects links AGN activity to star formation?
Can we observe ``AGN feedback'' in action, in situ, for the most
luminous sources at their peak activity?  Such unknowns about the
co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies remain among the
most fundamental unanswered questions in extragalactic astronomy.  And
they will be answered with the launch of the {\it James Webb Space
Telescope}.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
Our team has identified a population of obscured, mid-infrared bright
quasars at the peak of cosmological quasar activity.  These sources
are mid-IR luminous and may be powered by major bursts of star
formation tied to an early phase of galaxy
evolution/formation. However, their global star-formation properties
are currently unknown.  Observations with {\it JWST} MIRI, and in
particular MRS spectroscopy, will quantify the level of star-formation
in these objects.  {\it We will observe four ``extremely red'' quasars
with MIRI MRS across the full wavelength range to high signal to
noise.} These observations will address the fundamental question of
the link between star-formation and AGN activity, by quantifying and
studying the morphological and kinematic properties for both of these
processes; an investigation {\it JWST} was specifically built for.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
It is unknown whether the large IR luminosities observed in these
quasars is from star formation, which would produce strong polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) spectral features, or, if it is from the hot
dust near the central quasar, which should produce much weaker/no PAH
emission (due to the AGN MIR emission diluting and even destroying PAH
features). {\it Via the detection, or otherwise, of PAH spectral
features, we will measure the SFRs during what is potentially a very
early/obscured stage of massive galaxy formation in the extremely red
quasar population.}

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
MIRI MRS is the instrument of choice since no other spectrometer on
{\it JWST} observes longward of 5.3$\mu$m; going redder than this is
crucial in order to detect PAH features in $z>2$ objects.  If present
we will observe the most prominent, well-known major PAH emission
features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6$\mu$m. The mid-IR spectral region
also presents a suite of high-ionization lines and critically, we will
have access to the \nevi 7.65$\mu$m line which can be used to measure
the instantaneous luminosity of the central engine.  {\it The desire
to immediately gain high signal-to-noise spectra in order to
investigate the physics and chemistry of quasar PAHs, along with
observational overhead concerns, pushes us to observe each object for
3.59 hours, for a total program Charged Time of 22.20 hours.}


\section*{Community Access Rationale}
\vspace{-6pt}
\noindent
We have already begun to design and create science-enabling products
(SEPs) to help the community understand JWST's capabilities.  Our MIRI
MRS Repo \href{https://github.com/miri-mrs}{{\tt github.com/miri-mrs}}
is active and completely accessible to anyone in the broader
community.  The accompanying documentation is also already being
written: \href{http://miri-mrs.readthedocs.io/}{{\tt
miri-mrs.readthedocs.io}}.  {\it Our primary SEP goal is to produce a
Python package that quickly manipulates and analyzes the full MRS
Level 3 data, in particular the MRS Spectral Cubes and 1D spectra. }
We note there is already Python legacy code for this type of analysis:
\href{https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/}{\tt
spectral-cube.readthedocs.io}. Critically, we have
already begun working closely with the MIRI team (due to the P.I.'s
location at Edinburgh) and will continue to develop tools here for the
MIRI MRS.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
Our timeline has delivery of the first set (`beta') of MIRI MRS SEPs
before the Cycle 1 GO Deadline (March 2018); our v1.0.0 (with
e.g. MIRSim mock data) before the launch of JWST (October 2018) and
then rapid version updates once the start of science operations
commences in April 2019.

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
Our team's commitment to an open access ideology, not only for data,
but for analysis codes, documentation, and scientific manuscripts is
already evident and in place, for an example, see the P.I.'s GitHub
\href{https://github.com/d80b2t}{{\tt /github.com/d80b2t}}.  We are
thus extremely well-placed to satisfy the overall goals of the DD ERS
program.
