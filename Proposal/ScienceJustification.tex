One lasting scientific legacy of the {\it Hubble Space Telescope
(HST)} will be the discovery of giant black holes at the centers of
galaxies, confirming the longstanding theory of the ``central
engines'' of quasars.  One of the major surprises from the {\it
Hubble} was the discovery of a correlation between black hole mass and
host galaxy properties.\footnote{Assessment of Options for Extending
the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope: Final Report (2005);
https://www.nap.edu/read/11169/chapter/5).}  This connection, causal
or otherwise, may provide crucial clues to how and why these black
holes formed and how their host galaxies evolved. {\it As of the
launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the question of how
black holes affect their host galaxies is one of the outstanding
questions in astrophysics.}

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
Observational and theoretical work now suggests that active galaxies
and black holes are potentially linked to both the triggering, and
``quenching'', of massive star formation. The link between massive
galaxies and the central super-massive black holes (SMBHs) that seem
ubiquitous in them is now thought to be vital to the understanding of
galaxy formation and evolution, and huge observational and
theoretical effort has been invested in trying to measure and
understand the physics involved in these systems.  The two
main energy sources available to a galaxy are nuclear fusion in stars
and gravitational accretion onto compact objects, and we still do not
fully understand the interaction of an active galactic nuclei and the
star formation properties of their host galaxies, {\it especially at
the epoch of maximal cosmic SFR and quasar activity, redshifts $z\sim1-3$.}

\smallskip \smallskip
\noindent
The ``quenching'' of galaxy-wide star formation, is supposedly driven
by `` AGN feedback'', where the AGN helps to heat the surrounding gas
corona, offsetting cooling losses and disrupting the gas inflow. This
feedback manifests itself as high-velocity outflows from the
AGN/quasar.  However, {\it direct observational evidence} for AGN
feedback is conspicuous by its absence. This is especially true at
high-$z$, e.g. $z=2-3$, at the height of the Quasar Epoch.  We have
identified the best candidates that suggest we are seeing quasar
feedback in action, in situ at high-redshift. These are the
``Extremely Red Quasars'' identified via their WISE W3/4 colors.  As
such, these mJy luminous AGN {\it are ideal targets for JWST
MIRI}.


\section*{The Extremely Red Quasar Population} 
{\it ERQs are a unique obscured quasar population with extreme
physical conditions related to powerful outflows across the
line-forming regions. These sources are the signposts of the most
extreme form of quasar feedback at the peak epoch of galaxy formation,
and may represent an active ``blow-out'' phase of quasar evolution.  }

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
By matching the quasar catalogues of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Ross et al. (2015)
discovered quasars with extremely red infrared-to-optical colors:
$r_{\rm AB}-W4_{\rm Vega}>14$ mag, i.e., $F_\nu({\rm 22\mu
m})/F_\nu(r) \gtrsim 1000$; see Figure 1. These objects have infrared
luminosities $\sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  The original motivation
here was to look for PAHs that had redshifted in the WISE W4 band for
$z\approx2.5$ quasars in order to study and link luminous AGN activity
and star formation at the ``height of the quasar epoch''.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Hamann et al. (2017) then fully and properly refined the selection of
the ERQs, homing the definition based on further analysis and common
properties, and indeed found many more objects in this new scheme. The
ERQs have a suite of peculiar emission-line properties including large
rest equivalent widths (REWs), unusual ``wingless'' line profiles,
large \nv /\lya , \nv /\civ , \siiv /\civ\ and other flux ratios, and
very broad and blueshifted [\oiii ] \lam 5007 (e.g. spectrum in
Figure~1).

Our team identified a ``core'' sample of 97 ERQs with nearly uniform
peculiar properties selected via \imw\ $\ge 4.6$ (AB) and REW(\civ )
$\ge$ 100 \AA\ at redshifts 2.0--3.4.  The core ERQs have median
luminosity $\left<\log L ({\rm ergs/s})\right> \sim 47.1$, sky density
0.010 deg$^{-2}$, surprisingly flat/blue UV spectra given their red
UV-to-mid-IR colors, and common outflow signatures including BALs or
BAL-like features and large \civ\ emission-line blueshifts. Their
SEDs, see Figure~\ref{fig:ERQ_SED}, and line properties are
inconsistent with normal quasars behind a dust reddening
screen. Patchy obscuration by small dusty clouds could produce the
observed UV extinctions without substantial UV reddening.


\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
Further observations by our team with VLT-XShooter measured rest-frame
optical spectra of four $z\sim 2.5$ extremely red quasars (Zakamska et al. 2016).  
We discovered very broad (full width at half max$= 2600-5000$ km
s$^{-1}$), strongly blue-shifted (by up to 1500 km s$^{-1}$)
\oiii\ $\lambda$5007\AA\ emission lines in these objects. In a large
sample of type 2 and red quasars, \oiii\ kinematics are positively
correlated with infrared luminosity, and the four objects in our
sample are on the extreme end both in \oiii\ kinematics and infrared
luminosity.
%%
As such, we estimate that at least 3\% of the bolometric luminosity in
these objects is being converted into the kinetic power of the
observed wind. Photo-ionization estimates suggest that the \oiii
emission might be extended on a few kpc scales, which would suggest
that the extreme outflow is affecting the entire host galaxy of the
quasar.

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Given the extreme nature of these objects, especially in the 
kinematics,  what is actually powering the IR luminosity? 
Is it young, hot stars in a starburst, or hot dust powered by the central AGN?
Furthermore, how, if at all, is this IR emission connected to the
conditions at large of the quasar and host galaxy?}

%\medskip

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf \underline{MIR spectroscopy}:}
In order to quantify the main energy contribution in galaxies, one
needs to differentiate objects powered by nuclear fusion in stars
(i.e. normal and starburst galaxies) from objects powered by mass
accretion onto supermassive black holes (quasars and AGNs). 
MIR spectroscopy allows the detection of obscured AGN components even
when the MIR is dominated by the host galaxy. Several classification
diagrams have been developed to determine the AGN contribution to an
observed spectrum based on certain spectral features, such as high
ionisation emission lines like \nev, \neii and \oiv, the EW of PAH
features and the strength of the silicate feature at 9.7 $\mu$m (see,
e.g. Spoon et al., 2007; Armus et al., 2007; Veilleux et al., 2009;
Hernan-Caballero \& Hatziminaoglou, 2011). A number of techniques have
also been developed to model the observed MIR spectra and constrain
the AGN and starburst contributions (see e.g. Schweitzer et al., 2008;
Nardini et al., 2008; Deo et al., 2009; Feltre et al., 2013).

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
{\bf \underline{Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons}:}
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundant, ubiquitous, and
a dominant force in the interstellar medium of galaxies (see e.g.,
Tielens, 2008, ARAA, 46, 289 for a review).  Aromatic features are
already a significant component of dusty galaxy spectra as early as
$z\approx2$ (Yan et al., 2005, ApJ, 628, 604).  and the infrared (IR)
emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 $\mu$m are generally
attributed to IR fluorescence from (mainly) far-ultraviolet (FUV)
pumped large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. As such,
these features trace the FUV stellar flux and are thus a measure of
star formation (Peeters et al, 2004, ApJ, 613, 986).
%%
The interstellar IR emission spectrum is incredibly rich and shows a
wealth of detail.  It is dominated by major emission features at 3.3,
6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2, 12.7, and 16.4 $\mu$m.  In addition, there are
weaker features at 3.4, 3.5, 5.25, 5.75, 6.0, 6.9, 7.5, 10.5, 11.0,
13.5, 14.2, 17.4, and 18.9 $\mu$m.  Given the redshift of our ERQs and
the MIRI wavelength coverage we will coverage $1.36 \leq \lambda_{\rm
emitted} \leq 8.6 \mu$m.

%With our first science goal being to detect PAH features, a second goal will be to measure the strengths of the MIR emission lines such as [NeII] and [NeV].  are mentioned only briefly at one point, so it’s not clear if they are an objective of this program. I think we need to say more about that because, if those lines are present, we'll measure them. We should at least mention some specific lines and wavelengths and their potential implications for the science. But then what’s really needed for both these lines and the PAHs are estimates of the feature strengths (probably scaling from local ULIRG/quasar observations)...

\smallskip
\smallskip
\noindent
A final science goal, is the aim of obtaing {\it spatial information} you might get for the lines and PAHs. 
The IFU aspect of the Medium Resolution Spectrometer will allow, for the first time, detailed investigations of the both the central AGN IR emission and any potentially extended emission.
%I have not investigated MIRI capabilities at all, but if spatial info is a possibility, then we should discuss the feasibility compared to MIRI resolutions and sensitivities and, again, speculate on what different outcomes might mean for the science. 

\iffalse
 think this needs more development to get to the point of saying how we will interpret our observations. What will learn from different outcomes with strong/weak/absent PAH emission? We need to mention the alternative that the MIR could be from hot dust powered by the AGN. This scenario would yield weak PAHs, but I think it does imply low SFRs. This is not something I’ve worked on or thought about in any detail, but I think we should frame this as a question about what powers the MIR luminosities - hot stars in a starburst or the central AGN. That mean diving into the literature about PAH equivalent widths and how they’re interpreted in other sources across the ULIRG - quasar continuum, starting with the famous Genzel+98 diagrams but then more recent work… Another aspect of this is the spatial information. Maybe we will find weak PAHs in the nuclear regions and strong PAHs farther out. That seems likely. But then we should talk about the spatial resolution, spatial scales in kpc, compare that to the sizes measured for SMGs (they pretty compact, I think just a few kpc across). Etc.
